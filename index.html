       <p>I was born in Dallas, TX, but grew up in Richmond, VA.  I graduated from George Mason University in 2010 with a degree in economics.  I currently live in Arlington, VA.  I work as a QA Analyst for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
 
       <p>In my free time, I try to stay as active as possible.  You can find me in the gym 4-5 days a week.  I'm a huge sports junkie, and like to both watch and play sports.  As you can guess, I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan.</p>

       <p>Church is also a huge part of my life.  I attend Grace Community Church.  I've recently become really involved, serving on a number of different leadership teams as well as volunteering on Sundays.</p>
